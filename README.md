# python-cli-math-tools
Command line math tools written in python. 

These will all eventually be converted to be able to interact with each other (meaning they will return the values that they currently print to stdout)


### Currently supports:

- sqr.py squaring single number
- exp.py raises arvg[1] to the power of argv[2]
- int_gen.py generates random integers [n quantity] from [n] to [n] range - displays to stdout - can be piped >> and redirected for various purposes
- circle.py - calculate circle math
- cube.py - cubes single number argv[1]
- sqrt.py - Takes square root of argv[1] and prints to screen
- total.py - cli program that outputs sum total of indefinite list of supplied float/int args



### Plans to support:

- taking average of an indefinite list of integer entries
- factorials
- sample variance, sample std deviation, margin of error calculator
